# FRC Code / Electrical Bootcamp
CyBears coders new to FRC will ideally go through training to learn how FRC electronics and code work together.  The general idea behind a boot camp is to accelerate learning.  To attempt to take advantage of a bit of rapid learning, CyBears will therefore attempt to have each coding team member work through a key 'example project'.

The idea behind an example project will have each individual project interact with some form of input and have that signal control a form of robot output.  Successful completion of the project includes both checking in of the full project into the ChargedUp2023\camp\{team member} repo directory as well as demonstrating the functionality checked in works on the project test bed.

# Input and Output Pairings / Assignments

The table below highlights various challanges that coder members will be assigned as their bootcamp example project.

|Input Hardware | Output Hardware | Expected Outcome | Owner |
|--|--|--|--|
| XBox Controller Left Stick Y direction | Talon motor  | Use of the input of the Left stick y double/floating point value to control the speed of the motor | ?? |
| Multi-function joystick twist | Neo Motor | Use of the input of the joystick twist axist double/floating point value to control the speed of the motor | ?? |
| Button board two buttons | bag motor on/off in forward and reverse directions | Use one button to drive the motor in forward direction and the other button press to run the motor in the other direction | ?? |
| XBox Controller D-Pad up/down | Pneumatic double soleniod enable/disable | The intent here is to trigger a pneumatic solenoid using the xbox controller D-pad input as boolean values. | ?? |
| Beam break sensor | bag motor on/off in a single direction | Every time a beam break sensor is broken turn motor on, otherwise turn off motor | ?? |
| Distance sensor | Small neo motor? | As something comes into view of the sensor closer and closer motor speed increases.  When nothing is in view the motor is off | ?? |
| NavX various movements | Musical notes functionality on a Talon motor | Every time an axis movement on the navx occurs one of 6 notes is played on the Talon. | ?? |
